## Installation

- [Download the latest version here](https://github.com/Obbut/iCloud-Control/releases)
- Place the app in your Applications folder
- Launch it by right/control clicking and choosing "Open" (to prevent gatekeeper from preventing the app to open) and follow the instructions on screen

## Usage

The following options are provided trough a toolbar item in the Finder.

- **Remove selected item locally**: the selected item(s) will be removed from your device, while remaining in iCloud.
- **Download selected item**: download previously removed files from iCloud. On macOS Sierra, the cloud icon provides the same functionality.
- **Publish public link**: places a link to the selected file in your clipboard.

## Compatibility

iCloud Control should work on macOS 10.2 Sierra, and on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.
